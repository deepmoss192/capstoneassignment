## **Final report| The Battle of Neighborhoods- Etobicoke Toronto**
### Introduction:

<br>This project is aimed to select a place out of numbers of other neighborhoods in Toranto by analysing the database with the statistical method which we learned from previous sessions.<br/>
<br>This project through visualization present the area in Etobicoke. It gave huge and neutral information for those people who want to know this area. And also it is for  ease of accessing to Cafe, School, Super market, medical shops, grocery shops, mall, theatre, hospital, etc. <br/>
<br>It will help people to get awareness of the area and neighborhood before moving to a new city, state, country or place for their work or to start a new fresh life.<br/>
### The Location
<br>Etobicoke is an administrative district and one of six municipalities amalgamated into the city of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Comprising the city's west-end.<br/>
<br>Etobicoke has a highly diversified population, which totalled 365,143 in 2016. It is primarily suburban in development and heavily industrialized, resulting in a lower population density than the other districts of Toronto.<br/>
### Foursquare Api
<br>Foursquare is a database of more than 105 million places worldwide and an API that enables location data for Apple, Samsung, Microsoft, Tencent, Snapchat, Twitter, Uber, and others.The app provides personalized recommendations of places to go near a user's current location based on the userâ€™s previous visits, likes and check-in history.For this project, we use this api to gather the sources we want and use its powerful database to form my conclusion.<br/>
<br>The data retrieved from Foursquare contained information of venues within a specified distance of the longitude and latitude of the postcodes. The information obtained per venue as follows: **Neighborhood(Name and position) & Venue(Name and position) & Nearby stores**<br/>

### Clustering Approach:
<br>To compare the similarities between the two cities, we decided to explore the neighborhoods, subdivide them, and group them to find similar neighborhoods in big cities like New York and Toronto. In order to do this, we need to cluster data, which is a form of unsupervised machine learning k-means clustering algorithm<br/>

**Through K-means cluster algorithm I cleaned and seperated the specific cases from the database, which have very-similar neighborhoods around them. Etobicoke is a popular destination for newcomers to Canada. Therefore, it is one of the most diverse and diverse areas in the Greater Toronto Area, and the home to various religious groups and places of worship.**
